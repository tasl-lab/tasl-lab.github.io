## Highlights
{% capture text %}
The ultimate goal of our research is to build **trustworthy**, **interactive**, and **human-centered** autonomous embodied agents that can perceive, understand, and reason about the physical world; safely interact and collaborate with humans; and efficiently coordinate with other intelligent agents so that they can benefit society in daily lives. To accomplish this goal, our team has been pursuing interdisciplinary research and unifying the techniques and tools from robotics, trustworthy AI/ML, deep reinforcement learning, control theory, optimization, and computer vision.
