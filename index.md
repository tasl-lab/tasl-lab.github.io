## Highlights
{% capture text %}
The ultimate goal of our research is to build **trustworthy**, **interactive**, and **human-centered** autonomous agents that can perceive, understand, and reason about the physical world; safely interact and collaborate with humans and other agents, and clearly explain their behaviors to build trust with humans so that they can benefit society in daily lives. To achieve this goal, we have been pursuing interdisciplinary research and unifying the techniques and tools from robotics, machine learning, reinforcement learning, explainable AI, control theory, optimization, and computer vision.
