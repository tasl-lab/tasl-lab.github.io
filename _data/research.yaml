    We investigate relational reasoning and interaction modeling in the context of the trajectory prediction task, which aims to generate accurate, diverse future trajectory hypotheses or state sequences based on historical observations.
    Our research introduced the first unified relational reasoning toolbox that systematically infers the underlying relations/interactions between entities at different scales (e.g., pairwise, group-wise) and different abstraction levels (e.g., multiplex) by learning dynamic latent interaction graphs and hypergraphs from observable states (e.g., positions) in an unsupervised manner. 
    The learned latent graphs are explainable and generalizable, significantly improving the performance of downstream tasks, including prediction, sequential decision making, and control.
    We also proposed a physics-guided relational learning approach for physical dynamics modeling.
